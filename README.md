About
-----

This plugin allows you to filter Renga model by different conditions. 
The plugin functionality:
*   filtering objects by system object parameters (height, volume, surface area, etc.)
*   filtering objects by user properties.
*   exporting and importing filters from/into a file.

For example, using ModelFilter, you can filter all structural elements made of concrete or steel on some level or several levels or filter all rooms by category. You also can share filters with other users.

Using the filter you can hide, isolate or select objects using Filters dialog or context menu. Conditions in filters can be quite complex, however, it is easy to create and understand them.

### What the filter consists of

Each filter consists of one or more groups. Each group works (can filter) with a single object type.
A group contains search criteria for this object type, which are conditions for system object parameters 
or user defined properties. Search criteria work on the **AND** condition. 

**Group examples:** 
*   **Walls** _higher than 3 meters_ **AND** _with thickness equal to 200 cm_  **AND** _made of "Concrete"_.
*   **Beams** _longer than 2 meters_ **AND** _located on the "Ground floor"_.

Groups in a filter work on the **OR** condition, so combining groups described above in a single 
filter, after applying a filter, you will get high and thick walls made of concrete and long beams on the "Groud floor".

### How to create a filter

To add a new filter —Ålick the "Add" button, the "Filter adding" window will open. Here you can manage groups by using "Add", "Edit", "Delete" buttons.
In "Group adding" window you can set an object type and add a search criteria to the group.

To add the search criteria do following:
*   Select the property, the operator and the value for the criteria
*   Push the "Add" button
